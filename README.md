This is the frontend for my clone of Stayhard which I created for a school project.

## If you want to run the project

First you will need to clone and boot up the [https://github.com/EdvinTr/staytard-backend](https://github.com/EdvinTr/staytard-backend)

You will need to create a .env file and set the appropriate variables. There is a .env.example file which defines the structure needed.

Open up a terminal and type:
```
yarn install
yarn dev
```
The project will be visible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
